    wallet_faq_works_question_5: What data is contained in the QR code?
    wallet_faq_works_question_6: What do I need to do if I delete the COVID certificate or the app?
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_1: You can get a COVID certificate after a complete COVID-19 vaccination, after you have recovered from the virus or after you have tested negative. The certificate is generally issued upon request by health care professionals on site.
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_2: You can present your COVID certificate in hard copy or you can use the COVID Certificate app to save certificates in the app and present them directly from the app. You are free to choose whether you present your certificate in hard copy or in the app.\n\nPlease note that you will also need to show an identification document (passport or ID card) in either case.\n
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_3: Your data is not stored in a central system, but only locally on your mobile device or in the QR code in the case of the paper COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_4: The COVID certificate QR code contains an electronic signature. This is an important security feature and makes the COVID certificate forgery-proof. Moreover, the COVID certificate is valid only in combination with an identification document (passport or ID card).
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_5: Your COVID certificate is not stored in any central system. It is solely in your possession. Therefore, keep your paper COVID certificate in a safe place. If you lose the COVID certificate, you will have to request it again from the issuing office
    wallet_faq_works_answer_1: To add a COVID certificate to the app, you need the original certificate issued to you on paper or as a PDF document. You can use the COVID certificate app to scan the QR code on the original and add it to the app. The COVID certificate will then appear directly in the app.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_2: Yes, that is possible. For example, you can save the COVID certificates of all family members in your app. Also in this case, each COVID certificate is valid only in combination with an identification document (passport or ID card) of the certificate holder.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_3: The COVID Certificate app shows when your COVID certificate will expire in Switzerland. You can also use the details view to check at the touch of a button whether your COVID certificate is currently valid.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_4: Your personal data is not stored in a central system; instead, it can be found solely locally on the mobile device or in the QR code in the case of the paper COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_5: The QR code contains all the information that is found in plain text on your paper COVID certificate. The QR code also contains an electronic signature that can be used to check the authenticity of the COVID certificate. This makes the COVID certificate forgery-proof.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_6: You can easily restore your COVID certificate on your mobile device. To do so, download the app again and then scan the QR code on your paper or PDF COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_works_title: How the app works
    wallet_faq_works_subtitle: With the COVID Certificate app, you can easily and securely store and present COVID certificates on your mobile device.
    wallet_scanner_howitworks_answer1: You can get a COVID certificate after a complete COVID-19 vaccination, after you have recovered from the virus or after you have tested negative. The certificate is generally issued upon request by health care professionals on site.

    NSCameraUsageDescription: The app needs access to your camera to be able to scan the QR code.
    verifier_faq_works_title: How COVID certificates are checked
    verifier_faq_works_subtitle: The COVID Certificate Check app can be used to scan the QR codes on COVID certificates and check the certificates for authenticity and validity.
    verifier_faq_works_question_1: How can COVID certificates be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_1: To check a COVID certificate, use the dedicated COVID Certificate Check app to scan the QR code on the paper certificate or in the COVID Certificate app presented.
    verifier_faq_works_question_2: What exactly is checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_2: Three aspects are checked when scanning:\n– Does the certificate contain a valid electronic signature?\n– Is the certificate non-revoked?\n– Does the certificate meet Switzerland's validity criteria?\n\nIf the answer to all three questions is affirmative, the COVID certificate is shown as valid.
    verifier_faq_works_question_3: Which identification documents are valid? Why do personal details have to be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_3: Aside from passports or ID cards, other photo identification documents that prove the identity of the person in question (e.g. driving licence) are also accepted. Although the COVID certificate is forgery-proof, the only way to ensure that the certificate shown was issued to the person presenting it is to check the personal details.
    verifier_faq_works_question_4: Can foreign certificates also be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_4: Yes, COVID certificates that are compatible with the EU digital COVID certificate can be checked according to Switzerland's validity criteria using the COVID Certificate check app.
    verifier_faq_works_question_5: What data do I see during the verification process?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_5: During the verification process, you see only the certificate holder's name and date of birth, and whether the COVID certificate is valid.
    verifier_faq_works_question_6: Is any data stored in the COVID Certificate Check app or in a central system during the verification process?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_6: No, no data is stored during the verification process, be it in the COVID Certificate Check app or in a central system. Therefore, it is not possible to trace which COVID certificate was checked by whom, when and where.

    wallet_faq_questions_question_2_1: How long is the COVID certificate valid?
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_2_1: Just how long your certificate is valid depends on whether you have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID or have tested negative. The duration of validity may change in line with the latest scientific findings. The current duration of validity for COVID certificates can be found here:
    wallet_faq_questions_linktext_2_1: Further information

    wallet_faq_works_question_3_1: Can I use the app offline?
    wallet_faq_works_answer_3_1: You can use the app without an internet connection, so you can still call up your certificates and present them for scanning and verification.\n\nHowever, in order to show whether your certificate meets Switzerland’s validity criteria and how long it is valid for, the COVID Certificate app has to be online at regular intervals.
    verifier_faq_works_question_2_1: What are the current validity criteria in Switzerland?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_2_1: The current validity period of Covid certificates can be found here:

    verifier_faq_works_question_6: Is it possible to verify the certificates offline?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_6: In principle, COVID certificates can also be verified without an Internet connection. For this purpose, regularly updated checklists are downloaded from a central server. These locally stored checklists must not be older than 48 hours. \n\nIn order to update the checklists, the app must be open and connected to the Internet. Updating occurs immediately and automatically.
