    wallet_faq_works_question_5: What data is contained in the QR code?
    wallet_faq_works_question_6: What do I need to do if I delete the COVID certificate or the app?
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_1: You can get a COVID certificate after a complete COVID-19 vaccination, after you have recovered from the virus or after you have tested negative. The certificate is generally issued upon request by health care professionals on site.
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_2: You can present your COVID certificate in paper form, or you can use the COVID Certificate app to save certificates in the dedicated app. You are free to choose whether to present your certificate in paper form or in the app.\n\nPlease note that you will also need to show an identification document (passport or ID card) in either case.\n
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_3: Your data is not stored in a central system, but only locally on your mobile device or in the QR code in the case of the paper COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_4: The COVID certificate QR code contains an electronic signature. This is an important security feature and makes the COVID certificate forgery-proof. Moreover, the COVID certificate is valid only in combination with an identification document (passport or ID card).
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_5: Your COVID-19 certificate is not stored in any central system. It is solely in your possession. Therefore, keep your paper and/or PDF COVID-19 certificate in a safe place. If you lose your certificate and need to replace it, a fee may be charged.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_1: To add a COVID certificate to the app, you need the original certificate issued to you on paper or as a PDF document. You can use the COVID certificate app to scan the QR code on the original and add it to the app. The COVID certificate will then appear directly in the app.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_2: Yes, that is possible. For example, you can save the COVID certificates of all family members in your app. Also in this case, each COVID certificate is valid only in combination with an identification document (passport or ID card) of the certificate holder.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_3: The app automatically checks whether your certificate meets Switzerland's validity criteria. If your COVID certificate has expired or is technically invalid, this is indicated directly on the certificate in the app. 
    wallet_faq_works_answer_4: Your personal data is not stored in a central system; instead, it can be found solely locally on the mobile device or in the QR code in the case of the paper COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_5: The QR code contains all the information that is found in plain text on your paper COVID certificate. The QR code also contains an electronic signature that can be used to check the authenticity of the COVID certificate. This makes the COVID certificate forgery-proof.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_6: You can easily restore your COVID certificate on your mobile device. To do so, download the app again and then scan the QR code on your paper or PDF COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_works_title: How the app works
    wallet_faq_works_subtitle: With the COVID Certificate app, you can easily and securely store and present COVID certificates on your mobile device.
    wallet_scanner_howitworks_answer1: You can get a COVID certificate after a complete COVID-19 vaccination, after you have recovered from the virus or after you have tested negative. The certificate is generally issued upon request by health care professionals on site.

    NSCameraUsageDescription: The app needs access to your camera to be able to scan the QR code.
    verifier_faq_works_title: How COVID certificates are checked
    verifier_faq_works_subtitle: The COVID Certificate Check app can be used to scan the QR codes on COVID certificates and check the certificates for authenticity and validity.
    verifier_faq_works_question_1: How can COVID certificates be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_1: To check a COVID certificate, use the dedicated COVID Certificate Check app to scan the QR code on the paper certificate or in the COVID Certificate app presented.
    verifier_faq_works_question_2: What exactly is checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_2: Three aspects are checked when scanning:\n– Does the certificate contain a valid electronic signature?\n– Is the certificate unrevoked?\n– Does the certificate meet Switzerland's validity criteria?\n\nIf the answer to all three questions is affirmative, the COVID certificate is shown as valid.
    verifier_faq_works_question_3: Which identification documents are valid? Why do personal details have to be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_3: Aside from passports or ID cards, other photo identification documents that prove the identity of the person in question (e.g. driving licence) are also accepted. Although the COVID certificate is forgery-proof, the only way to ensure that the certificate shown was issued to the person presenting it is to check the personal details.
    verifier_faq_works_question_4: Can foreign certificates also be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_4: Yes, COVID certificates that are compatible with the EU digital COVID certificate can be checked according to Switzerland's validity criteria using the COVID Certificate check app.
    verifier_faq_works_question_5: What data do I see during the verification process?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_5: During the verification process, you see only the certificate holder's name and date of birth, and whether the COVID certificate is valid.
    verifier_faq_works_question_6: Is any data stored in the COVID Certificate Check app or in a central system during the verification process?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_6: No, no data is stored during the verification process, be it in the COVID Certificate Check app or in a central system. Therefore, it is not possible to trace which COVID certificate was checked by whom, when and where.

    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_subtitle: The transfer codes allow COVID certificates to be transmitted quickly and securely. In this way, you receive your certificate (e.g. after a test) directly in the application.
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_question_1: Who offers the transmission of the COVID certificate by transfer code?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_question_2: Can the transfer codes also be used for the transmission of vaccination certificates?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_question_3: How does the transmission of the certificate by transfer code work?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_question_4: Can I use the same transfer code more than once?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_answer_1: If you perform a COVID test (PCR test or rapid antigen test), the transfer code can be used to quickly transmit the COVID certificate.\n\nAsk your test centre, pharmacy or doctor if this option is available.
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_answer_2: Currently, the transmission of the certificate by transfer code is reserved for COVID tests. To find out how to obtain a COVID certificate after vaccination, click here:
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_answer_3: If the test centre offers to transmit the certificate by transfer code, you will be asked for a code at the time of registration or testing.\n\nYou can create the transfer code in the "COVID Certificate" application: press "Add" on the home screen or the "More" symbol at the bottom right, then "Create a transfer code".\n\nThe application will show you a 9-character code, which you can either enter in a form when you register or pass on directly during the test.
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_questions_answer_4: No, a transfer code can only be used once. If you wish to obtain several certificates (e.g. for your relatives), please create a new code for each certificate.
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_title: How does the transfer work?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_question_1: How is my data secured during the transfer?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_question_2: What if my certificate does not arrive in the application?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_question_3: What happens if I test positive?
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_answer_1: For the transfer, your COVID certificate is delivered in encrypted form. The transfer code ensures that only your application can receive the certificate. The data is deleted from the server immediately after the transfer.
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_answer_2: Once the certificate has been generated by the laboratory or test centre, it is available for transfer. Make sure that your smartphone is connected to the Internet to receive certificates.\n\nIf you still do not receive your certificate, contact the place where you performed the test (centre, pharmacy, doctor's practice).
    wallet_transfer_code_faq_works_answer_3: In case of a positive rapid antigen test, you will not receive a COVID certificate from the laboratory.\n\nIn case of a positive PCR test, you will receive a COVID certificate for cured persons, valid from the 11th day after the test.

    wallet_faq_questions_question_2_1: How long is the COVID certificate valid?
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_2_1: Just how long your certificate is valid depends on whether you have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID or have tested negative. The duration of validity may change in line with the latest scientific findings. The current duration of validity for COVID certificates can be found here:

    wallet_faq_works_answer_3_1: You can use the app without an internet connection, so you can still call up your certificates and present them for scanning and verification.\n\nHowever, in order to show whether your certificate meets Switzerland’s validity criteria and how long it is valid for, the COVID Certificate app has to be online at regular intervals.
    verifier_faq_works_question_2_1: What are the current validity criteria in Switzerland?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_2_1: The current validity period of COVID certificates can be found here:

    verifier_faq_works_question_7: Is it possible to verify the certificates offline?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_7: In principle, COVID certificates can also be verified without an Internet connection. For this purpose, regularly updated checklists are downloaded from a central server. These locally stored checklists must not be older than 48 hours. \n\nIn order to update the checklists, the app must be open and connected to the Internet. Updating occurs immediately and automatically.

    wallet_faq_questions_question_6: What is the 'certificate light'
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_6: The COVID Certificate app offers holders of COVID certificates the possibility of generating a copy of the certificate with minimised data. This 'certificate light' merely shows that the holder has a valid COVID certificate but does not contain any health-related data. \n\nThe alternative to the COVID certificate containing minimised data was developed at the wish of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) as third parties using apps they have developed themselves could be able to see health-related data such as the vaccine administered or date of vaccination when checking the certificate. The 'certificate light' prevents this.\n\nThe 'Certificate light' is only available electronically in the app and is only recognised in Switzerland. For data protection reasons the 'certificate light' is only valid for {LIGHT_CERT_VALIDITY_IN_H} hours and must then be reactivated. If you need to use the normal certificate before the end of the {LIGHT_CERT_VALIDITY_IN_H}-hour period, you can simply deactivate the 'certificate light'.

    verifier_faq_works_question_9: How can a 'certificate light' be converted back into an EU/EFTA-compliant COVID certificate?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_9: The holder can deactivate a 'certificate light' any time in their COVID Certificate app. After that their normal COVID certificate is available again.

    wallet_faq_works_question_5_1: I only have my COVID certificate electronically in the app. How can I get the certificate as a PDF or on paper?

    cert_renewal_info_info_heading: What does this mean?
    cert_renewal_info_info_text_1: The QR codes used for COVID certificates have limited technical validity
    cert_renewal_info_info_text_2: To enable this certificate to continue to be checked (e.g. when you’re travelling), you must renew the QR code.
    cert_renewal_info_info_text_3: You can do this directly here in the app (provided you have an internet connection). The data in your current certificate will be encrypted and sent to the federal government’s COVID certificate issuing system for a new QR code to be issued. This QR code is then sent back to the app. Once the new QR code has been issued and the data sent, the data on the government system are deleted.
    cert_renewal_info_info_text_4: Check out this FAQ to find out why you should also renew the QR code if your vaccination or recovery certificate is about to expire or has already expired under the Swiss validity rules.
    cert_renewal_info_expired_heading: What does this mean?
    cert_renewal_info_expired_text_1: The QR codes used for COVID certificates have limited technical validity.

    cert_renewal_info_renewed_heading: Important!
    cert_renewal_info_renewed_text_1: Also replace certificates you have previously printed out or stored with this renewed version.
    cert_renewal_info_renewed_text_2: The length of time for which a vaccination is recognised in a particular country is not specified in the certificate. Instead, it is calculated in accordance with the specific rules of the country each time the certificate is checked. Renewing the QR code merely ensures that the QR code can be used from a technical point of view.

    wallet_update_boarding_page_1_title: What’s new?
    wallet_update_boarding_page_1_text: The COVID certificate now no longer displays the Validity in Switzerland field. Instead, the app shows the time of your vaccination or test. Why?
    wallet_update_boarding_page_2_title: COVID certificates in Switzerland
    wallet_update_boarding_page_2_bullet_1: The certificate requirement in Switzerland was lifted in February 2022.
    wallet_update_boarding_page_2_bullet_2: Since then, the Swiss validity periods have only existed formally and no longer have any practical significance in this country.
    wallet_update_boarding_page_2_bullet_3: The Swiss validity period also has no meaning abroad.
    wallet_update_boarding_page_3_title: COVID certificates abroad
    wallet_update_boarding_page_3_bullet_1: Abroad the rules of the country in question apply.
    wallet_update_boarding_page_3_bullet_2: The app now shows how many days ago you had the vaccination or a test.

    wallet_update_boarding_page_4_title: Current situation in Switzerland and worldwide
