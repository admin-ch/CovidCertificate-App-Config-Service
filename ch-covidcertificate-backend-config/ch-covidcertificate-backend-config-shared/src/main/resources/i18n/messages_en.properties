    wallet_faq_questions_answer_1: You can get a COVID-19 certificate after a complete COVID-19 vaccination, after you have recovered from the virus or after you have tested negative. The certificate is generally issued upon request by health care professionals on site.
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_2: You can present your COVID certificate in hard copy or you can use the COVID Certificate app to save certificates in the app and present them directly from the app. You are free to choose whether you present your certificate in hard copy or in the app.\n\nPlease note that you will also need to show an identification document (passport or ID card) in either case.\n
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_3: Your data is not stored in a central system, but only locally on your mobile device or in the QR code in the case of the paper COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_4: The COVID certificate QR code contains an electronic signature. This is an important security feature and makes the COVID certificate forgery-proof. Moreover, the COVID certificate is valid only in combination with an identification document (passport or ID card).
    wallet_faq_questions_answer_5: Your COVID certificate is not stored in any central system. It is solely in your possession. Therefore, keep your paper COVID certificate in a safe place. If you lose the COVID certificate, you will have to request it again from the issuing office
    wallet_faq_works_answer_1: To add a COVID-19 certificate to the app, you need the original certificate issued to you on paper or as a PDF document. You can use the COVID-19 certificate app to scan the QR code on the original and add it to the app. The COVID-19 certificate will then appear directly in the app.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_2: Yes, that is possible. For example, you can save the COVID certificates of all family members in your app. Also in this case, each COVID certificate is valid only in combination with an identification document (passport or ID card) of the certificate holder.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_3: The COVID Certificate app shows when your COVID certificate will expire in Switzerland. You can also use the details view to check at the touch of a button whether your COVID certificate is currently valid.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_4: Your personal data is not stored in a central system; instead, it can be found solely locally on the mobile device or in the QR code in the case of the paper COVID certificate.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_5: The QR code contains all the information that is found in plain text on your paper COVID certificate. The QR code also contains an electronic signature that can be used to check the authenticity of the COVID certificate. This makes the COVID certificate forgery-proof.
    wallet_faq_works_answer_6: You can easily restore your COVID certificate to your mobile device. To do so, scan the QR code on your paper or PDF COVID certificate again.

    verifier_faq_works_title: How COVID certificates are checked
    verifier_faq_works_subtitle: The COVID Certificate Check app can be used to scan the QR codes on COVID certificates and check the certificates for authenticity and validity.
    verifier_faq_works_question_1: How can COVID certificates be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_1: To check a COVID certificate, scan the QR code on the paper certificate or in the COVID Certificate app presented.
    verifier_faq_works_question_2: What exactly is checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_2: Three aspects are checked when scanning:\n– Does the certificate contain a valid electronic signature?\n– Is the certificate non-revoked?\n– Does the certificate meet Switzerland's validity criteria?\n\nIf the answer to all three questions is affirmative, the COVID certificate is shown as valid.
    verifier_faq_works_question_3: Which identification documents are valid? Why do personal details have to be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_3: Passports and ID cards are accepted as valid identification documents. Although the COVID certificate is forgery-proof, the only way to ensure that the certificate shown was issued to the person presenting it is to check the personal details.
    verifier_faq_works_question_4: Can foreign certificates also be checked?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_4: Yes, COVID certificates that are compatible with the EU's Digital Green Certificate can be checked according to Switzerland's validity criteria using the COVID Certificate check app.
    verifier_faq_works_question_5: What data do I see during the verification process?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_5: During the verification process, you see only the certificate holder's name and date of birth, and whether the COVID certificate is valid.
    verifier_faq_works_question_6: Is any data stored in the COVID Certificate Check app or in a central system during the verification process?
    verifier_faq_works_answer_6: No, no data is stored during the verification process, be it in the COVID Certificate Check app or in a central system. Therefore, it is not possible to trace which COVID certificate was checked by whom, when and where.
    wallet_certificate_detail_note: This certificate is not a travel document. \n\nThe scientific evidence on COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery continues to evolve, also in view of new variants of concern of the virus. \n\nBefore travelling, please check the applicable public health measures and related restrictions applied at the point of destination.
